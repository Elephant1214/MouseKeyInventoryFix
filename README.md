# Mouse Key Inventory Fix
A simple mod that uses mixins to fix an issue that has been in the game for a long time

## Building From Source
Clone the repo to a local folder and open it in your IDE then run `./gradlew build` to build for all versions,
or `./gradlew subproject:build`, replacing `subproject` with the subproject of the game version and mod loader you want.

This mod is in the public domain since it is a bug fix.
